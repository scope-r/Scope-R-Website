# Scope-R Website

The official repository for https://scope-r.app and https://scope-r.com.

The content contained in this repository is published via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and made available publicly in an effort to make Scope-R as transparent as possible!

## Building Project

The current project uses Gulp to build and serve static site assets. Use the `gulp` command to build the project and make it available over `http://localhost:80`.

### Directories

When building, the project will distribute assets in the `dist` folder for publication.

The current directory structure maintains a mostly flat hierarchy by making most pages available from the root with the exception of the `assets` folder which currently contains static site assets.

A `demos` folder is available for demonstration of available site pages and themes.

## Testing
Use the `gulp` command to build the project and perform functional and visual validation. Using the browser console, ensure that script execution and site authoring does not cause any errors to be logged.
